                     <h4>Food for family </h4>
                     <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.That's why we will provide food in the affected area </p>

                       <p>Shelter is one of the most important issue in flood situation.Most of the people lost their home because of flood.Thats why we will produce tent and other thing to shelter them.</p>

                     <p>We also produce shelter in normal sitution.
                      In Bangladesh we work with our partner organisation, Mukti Cox’s Bazar to provide education for almost 9,000 Rohingya refugee and slum dwelling children living in and around Kutupalong refugee camp, Cox’s Bazar and the Doharazi Enclaves.
                      In the slums of Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh families face extreme poverty, forcing many children to work and miss out on going to school. In the Doharazi Enclaves, Rohingya refugees who have moved further inland from  the crowded border camps are cut off from education.
